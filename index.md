- The colors used do not correlate to any value
- There are too many colors used
- There's no ordering to the states' appearance
- Grid lines make it difficult to read
- there are no axes labels
    - the lack of x axis labels makes the graph misleading because the measurement is unclear
- the source of the data is not present
